# Exploring-the-Evolution-of-Linux
We explore the evolution of the Linux operating system by examining its version control system.

### Project Description
Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, we read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors, there was some data cleaning and wrangling challenges encountered, but  we were able to gain insights about the development activities over the last 13 years.
